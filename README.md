# Enumerable Methods  

> In this section I learned about the Enumerable module that gets mixed into the Array and Hash classes (among others) and provides you with lots of handy iterator methods. To prove that there‚Äôs no magic to it, you‚Äôre going to rebuild those methods.

I had to use `yield` and the `#call` method to accomplished.

## Built With
