# Enumerable Methods  

> In this section I learned about the Enumerable module that gets mixed into the Array and Hash classes (among others) and provides you with lots of handy iterator methods. To prove that there’s no magic to it, you’re going to rebuild those methods.

I had to use `yield` and the `#call` method to accomplished.

## Built With

- Ruby 2.6

## Getting start

In order to start with the project:

1. You need to have ruby environment installed. [Click here for instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
2. Clone [this repository :blue_book:](https://github.com/bertil291utn/enumerabe-methods.git)
3. Run the algorithm file
    - In a terminal window write `ruby `*`[your_file_path]`*`enumerable_method_asignment.rb`

## Testing

> We are using [RSpec testing tool](https://rspec.info/) to test all enumerable methods. Also some detailed [documentation](https://relishapp.com/rspec/docs) about this tool

### Install
- In a terminal window type `gem install rspec`
- Once rspec install has finished, type `rspec --init`
- You will see a folder `spec` and a file `.rspec`
- Inside `spec` folder you'll see a `spec_helper.rb` file.

### Run
> We have already created a file called `enumerable_spec.rb`, if you want to create another one with the end *`[your file name]`*`_spec.rb`
- Open `./spec/enumerable_spec.rb` file
- Open a terminal window and type `rspec`
- If all test were passed you will see:

Else you'll see a red message, then check errors and fix them
